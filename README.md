Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes, the classes being legitimate transactions versus fraudulent ones. We'll use `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. 

Our data comes from the fictional LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company; We'll oversample the data using the `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms, and undersample the data using the `ClusterCentroids` algorithm.  Included is the dataset: `LoanStats_2019Q1.csv`
